The owner most recently created a repository and added her homework files to it, then shared access with me so I can now add partner files to her repository. The commit Id is 8591f60 by the username shelliej.

I was able to knit the owner's homework files without any errors.  

The difficulty I encountered was testing out too many codes in order to complete this assignment which made it very messy and extremely difficult to finish the lab in a timely manner. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
